Operation    |   Time Complexity
Add          |        O(1)
Search       |        O(n)
Traverse     |        O(n)
Delete       |        O(n)

Limitations of Arrays:
- Fixed size â€“ you must define max size in advance (MAX_EMPLOYEES).
- Insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions are inefficient (require shifting).
- No dynamic resizing or built-in search operations.

Usage of Arrays:
- When number of records is fixed or predictable
- When you need fast indexed access and simple logic
- When memory overhead should be minimal

Q. Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.
(Ans)
Array in Memory:
- Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory where each element is of the same data type.
- Elements are accessed via indexing, allowing O(1) access time.

Advantages of Arrays:
- Fast access using index: arr[i] â†’ O(1)
- Simple and memory-efficient for fixed-size datasets

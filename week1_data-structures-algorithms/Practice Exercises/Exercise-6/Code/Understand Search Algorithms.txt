Q1. Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
(Ans) 
Linear Search:
- Traverses each element one by one until it finds a match.
- Works on unsorted data.
- Time complexity: O(n)

Binary Search:
- Works by dividing the sorted list into halves.
- Requires sorted data.
- Time complexity: O(log n)

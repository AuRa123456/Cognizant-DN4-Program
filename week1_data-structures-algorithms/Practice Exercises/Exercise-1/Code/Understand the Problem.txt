Q1. Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
(Ans) 
- Efficient search, insert, update, delete operations are necessary when dealing with large inventories.
- Without proper structures, performance degrades with scale.

Q2. Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
(Ans)ArrayList: Good for ordered data, but slow search/update/delete (O(n)).
HashMap: Ideal for fast lookups, updates, and deletions using keys (O(1) on average).

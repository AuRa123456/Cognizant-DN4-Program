Bubble Sort:
Time Complexity: O(n²) (always)
Space: O(1)
Good for small data only.

Quick Sort:
Time Complexity: Best/Average: O(n log n), Worst: O(n²)
Space: O(log n) due to recursive calls
Faster and more efficient for larger data sets.

Quick Sort is preferred for the following reasons:
- Faster for most practical datasets
- Fewer swaps and comparisons than Bubble Sort
- Easy to implement and modify

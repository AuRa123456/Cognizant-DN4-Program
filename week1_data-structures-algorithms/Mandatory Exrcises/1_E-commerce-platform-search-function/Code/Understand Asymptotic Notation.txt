Q1. Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
(Ans) Big O notation is the upper bound of the time taken by an algorithm as its input keeps growing.

Q2. Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
(Ans) 
Best-Case Scenario:
- The target is found almost immediately.
- Minimal resources are usedâ€”time, energy, money.
- There are no false positives or distractions.
- High confidence in results with strong verification.

Average-Case Scenario:
- The search takes a moderate amount of time and effort.
- There might be some inefficiencies or minor errors.
- Resources are adequately allocated but not optimized.
- Results are eventually reliable but may require validation or iteration.

Worst-Case Scenario:
- The target is not found at all or is found too late.
- The operation consumes excessive resources with low return.
- High chance of false positives, ambiguity, or outright failures.
